## Enhanced Content Guidelines for Developing Unique and Quality C++ Content

### **Format:**
- All content must be written in Markdown format for readability and consistency.
- Include proper formatting for C++ code snippets using backticks (\`) to ensure clear syntax highlighting.

### **Code Snippets:**
- Use realistic and context-driven examples to make algorithms relatable to real-world scenarios.
- Avoid comments within the code snippets; ensure they are self-explanatory through their structure.
- Use meaningful variable and function names to enhance understanding and relevance.
- Test all algorithms for correctness and edge cases to ensure accuracy.

### **Answer Format:**
- Each question must have exactly four options, with only one correct answer.
- Ensure incorrect options are:
  - **Plausible:** They should closely resemble the correct answer or contain common mistakes.
  - **Diverse:** Cover a range of plausible errors or variations to avoid predictability.
  - **Randomized:** The correct answer's position should be randomized among the four.

### **Answer Explanation:**
- Provide a concise, yet thorough explanation (up to 100 words) for each answer.
- Break down the solution step-by-step, detailing the role of each algorithm component.
- Highlight the logic and reasoning behind the correct answer while briefly addressing why the incorrect options fail.
- Use diagrams or tables (if needed) to clarify relationships or outputs.

## Additional Guidelines for Unique and High-Quality Content

1. **Variety and Creativity:**
   - Ensure all questions are distinct and avoid repetition of concepts or patterns.
   - Incorporate real-world scenarios (e.g., sorting algorithms for large data sets, binary search applications, tree traversals).
   - Use diverse question types such as:
     - **Output Prediction:** Candidates predict the output of the given code.
     - **Error Identification:** Candidates identify and correct errors in a code snippet.
     - **Blank Filling:** Candidates complete missing parts in the code.
     - **Code Debugging:** Candidates find and fix errors in the code.

2. **Problem Statement Design:**
   - Provide problem statements with sufficient information to make the question self-contained.
   - Use well-defined problems that mimic real-world applications (e.g., finding the shortest path, sorting large datasets).

3. **Clarity and Precision:**
   - Ensure the language is clear and concise without ambiguity.
   - Avoid overly complex phrasing that could confuse candidates.

4. **Balanced Difficulty Distribution:**
   - Maintain a proportionate mix of easy, medium, and hard questions in a set.
   - Gradually increase complexity within the set for a smooth progression.

5. **Scalability and Reusability:**
   - Structure content in a modular way so individual questions can be reused or adapted easily.
   - Focus on creating questions that can be extended into different difficulty levels with minor tweaks.

6. **Error-Free Content:**
   - Test all algorithms and ensure they execute as intended without logical errors.
   - Proofread all text for grammatical correctness and coherence.

7. **Engagement:**
   - Include interactive elements such as solving an algorithmic problem or analyzing the time complexity of a solution.

8. **Feedback Mechanism:**
   - For explanation-based questions, highlight both the correct and incorrect reasoning clearly.
   - Provide learning tips or additional references for deeper understanding of the concept.

## Question Styles and Difficulty Levels

### **Easy Questions:**
Involve basic comprehension and application of fundamental C++ concepts, such as identifying syntax errors or predicting the result of simple algorithms.

### **Medium Questions:**
Require understanding and applying intermediate principles, such as debugging algorithms with multiple conditions or explaining the result of moderately complex code snippets.

### **Hard Questions:**
Challenge deep C++ knowledge and problem-solving skills, involving optimization, advanced algorithmic structures, and multi-stage problems.

## Question Types:
Generate the questions using the following four question type:

- **Output Prediction:** Candidates predict the output of the given code.

- **Error Identification:** Candidates identify and correct errors in a code snippet.

- **Blank Filling:** Candidates complete missing parts in the code.

- **Code Debugging:** Candidates find and fix errors in the code.

- **Time complexity:** Candidates predict the time complexity of the give code.

- **Space complexity:** Candidates predict the space complexity of the give code.

## Instructions for Generating Algorithm Analysis Questions

Generate the questions using the following JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "question_text": "What will be the output of the following C++ code that prints the elements of an array?",
    "code_data": "#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n  int arr[] = {5, 7, 9, 11};\n  int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);\n  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    cout << arr[i] << \" \";\n  }\n  return 0;\n}",
    "answer_count": 4,
    "options": {
      "5 7 9 11 ": "TRUE",
      "7 5 11 9 ": "FALSE",
      "5 7 9 ": "FALSE",
      "5 9 11 7 ": "FALSE"
    },
    "difficulty_level": "EASY",
    "answer_explanation_content": "The code prints the elements of the array in order. The correct output is '5 7 9 11' because the for loop iterates over the entire array."
  }
]
```

**Note**:
- Output should only generated from Reference Questions content.
- Make sure your response will be json string in the given format and which can be easily parsed to json object.
- [IMPORTANT] Your responses should only contain the json without any backtick or any kind of formatting. It should be a single  json string which can be parsed into json directly.
